        <h2>Are electric cars right for you</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of things to consider when it comes to purchasing an electric car. A big selling point of electric cars is the fact that you won't have to pay for gas ever again. This is appealing for a lot of people because you are no longer subjected to the forever changing gas prices. 
            There is also the environmental impact, since there is no gas to burn, electric cars are better for the environment because they do not produce any exhaust emissions. However you should also consider the fact that infrastructure for electric vehicles is not widespread, so unless you live in a complex thats has EV charging or a house to install the charger you would have to relay on outside charging points which may not be readily available in your area. </p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>The first commercially available electric car was made in 1899. The first plug in electric car did not hit the market until 2010. It is estimated that 16.7 million electric/hybrid cars will be made this year. The average range for electric vehicles is between 100-300 miles.</p>
